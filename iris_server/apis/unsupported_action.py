"""Decline a physical request the G1 has no approved action for.

Iris inherited Pepper's movement APIs, which answer any motion request by
having an LLM invent NAO joint angles ("RShoulderPitch", "RWristYaw"). The G1
has neither those joints nor that contract, so a request like "can you wipe
your hands?" produced joint angles for the wrong robot.

Saying so is the honest answer, and naming what Iris *can* do turns a refusal
into an offer.
